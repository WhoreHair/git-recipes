    <h2>A delicious and authentic Italian recipe</h2>
    <p>This lasagna recipe will be the last one you’ll ever use. My Italian family’s recipe can now be yours; it’s classic, simple, and absolutely delicious, as well as being a perfect freezer meal!</p>
    <h3> Ingredients:</h3>
    <p> Meat Sauce</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil (good quality like Partanna)</li>
        <li>3 or 4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>Approximately 42 oz Italian tomato purée (passata) or whole tomatoes, puréed (the very best choice is San Marzano dell’Agro Sarnese-Nocerino, DOP) (If using 24 oz jars, you’ll need 1 3/4 jars – if using 28 oz cans, use 1 1/2 cans.)</li>
        <li>Kosher or sea salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh basil</li>
    
    </ul>
    <p>Bechamel sauce</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 oz butter</li>
        <li>4 oz flour</li>
        <li>24 oz warm milk, whole is best</li>
        <li>A dash of nutmeg</li>
        <li>Kosher or sea salt</li>
        <li>white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb lasagna noodles or sheets (use pasta from Italy, or homemade, for best results)</li>
        <li>10 oz shredded mozzarella cheese (whole milk, low moisture) I recommend shredding your own cheese or you can also use fresh mozzarella, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to sprinkle on top</li>


    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Meat Sauce</li>
           <p>In a large, heavy pot, put the olive oil, garlic and parsley over medium high heat. When the garlic begins to brown, increase the heat and add the ground beef. Break up the beef, but keep it rather chunky. Sprinkle with about 1/2 tsp of salt. 

           </p>
           <p>When the beef is beginning to dry up, add the tomatoes and stir well. Add more salt, then lower the heat and allow to simmer for about an hour, stirring from time to time. Taste for salt and add pepper.</p>
           <p>When the sauce is ready, add the torn basil leaves. Remove about a cup (8 oz) of plain sauce (leave the ground beef in the pot and save for the top layer). If you make my quick Italian tomato sauce and happen to have some made, you can use that instead. Refrigerate the meat sauce when cool, or set aside if using right away.

            </p>
            
        <li>Make the Bechamel Sauce (while the sauce is simmering).</li>
          <p>Melt the butter in a medium pot then add the flour. Keep stirring to cook the flour for at least 5 minutes, but don’t let it brown. Pour in a little of the milk, and stir quickly to incorporate.Continue stirring and adding milk a little at a time. Once all the milk is mixed into the flour and butter mixture, add more.</p>
          <p>When all the milk has been added, season with about 1/2 tsp salt, a dash of nutmeg and about 1/4 tsp white pepper. Taste and adjust as needed. Keep a lid on the sauce if not using right away.</p>
        <li>Cook the Noodles (Skip this step if using no-cook lasagna noodles).</li>
          <p>Boil the noodles in plenty of salted water, making sure to keep moving them so they don’t stick together. Remove the noodles from the heat 5 minutes BEFORE the instructed time on the box. Reserve about 2 cups of the pasta water. Drain most of the water and then fill the pot with cold water just to cover the noodles. This will stop the pasta from cooking further.

          </p>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna</li>
          <p>Put a thin layer of sauce (no meat) on the very bottom of the pan. Add three pieces of lasagna lengthwise, then top generously with a quarter of the bechamel sauce. Next, dollop on the meat sauce, but don’t add so much that the lasagna will only be sauce at the end. Sprinkle on about a quarter of the mozzarella. Then top with more lasagna sheets, however, this time, cut them to 9″ strips so that you can place them in the opposite direction. This gives the lasagna structure so that it can hold together when cut. Cut the pieces so that it covers the bottom layer without leaving too much space.



          </p>
          <p>Repeat with the bechamel, meat sauce and mozzarella another three times so that there are 5 layers of pasta and 4 layers of filling. 
            

          </p>
          <p>You may or may not have leftover meat sauce, depending on how much sauce you added. However, if you do use it all, take some of the reserved pasta water (about a cup) and rinse the pot with it and add it to the lasagna before the top layer goes on. Alternatively, just pour the water directly onto the lasagna. We didn’t fully cook the pasta, so it will absorb more liquid as it cooks in the oven. The top of the lasagna will have the strips lengthwise, so I usually pull four (I overlap the top layer) of the best looking pieces (which aren’t broken or cut) and save them for the top. 





          </p>
          <p>Lastly, sprinkle some grated Parmesan on top of the lasagna before baking.

          </p>
        <li>Bake the Lasagna</li>
          <p>Cover with foil (but make sure the foil doesn’t touch the lasagna as tomatoes will eat through the foil) and put in a preheated 400 F (200 C) degree oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how crispy you want the top.

        </p>
        <p>The edges will be bubbly when you remove it from the oven, so be careful. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before cutting.

        </p>
        <p>Add a sprig of basil and serve!</p>
    </ol>
